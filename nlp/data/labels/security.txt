__label__Security previously, including untrusted objects as react children [could result in an xss security vulnerability](http://danlec.com/blog/xss-via-a-spoofed-react-element). this problem should be avoided by properly validating input at the application layer and by never passing untrusted objects around your application code. as an additional layer of protection, [react now tags elements](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/4832) with a specific [es2015 (es6) `symbol`](http://www.2ality.com/2014/12/es6-symbols.html) in browsers that support it, in order to ensure that react never considers untrusted json to be a valid element. if this extra security protection is important to you, you should add a `symbol` polyfill for older browsers, such as the one included by [babelâ€™s polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/).
