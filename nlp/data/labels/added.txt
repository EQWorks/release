__label__Added "[jira] [hbase-5074] support checksums in hbase- block cache--author: dhruba--summary:-hfile is enhanced to store a checksum for each block. hdfs checksum verification-is avoided while reading data into the block cache. on a checksum verification-failure  we retry the file system read request with hdfs checksums switched on-(thanks todd).--i have a benchmark that shows that it reduces iops on the disk by about 40%. in-this experiment  the entire memory on the regionserver is allocated to the-regionserver's jvm and the os buffer cache size is negligible. i also measured-negligible (<5%) additional cpu usage while using hbase-level checksums.--the salient points of this patch:--1. each hfile's trailer used to have a 4 byte version number. i enhanced this so-that these 4 bytes can be interpreted as a (major version number  minor-version). pre-existing hfiles have a minor version of 0. the new hfile format-has a minor version of 1 (thanks mikhail). the hfile major version remains-unchanged at 2. the reason i did not introduce a new major version number is-because the code changes needed to store/read checksums do not differ much from-existing v2 writers/readers.--2. introduced a hfilesystem object which is a encapsulates the filesystem-objects needed to access data from hfiles and hlogs.  hdfs filesystem objects-already had the ability to switch off checksum verifications for reads.--3. the majority of the code changes are located in hbase.io.hfie package. the-retry of a read on an initial checksum failure occurs inside the hbase.io.hfile-package itself.  the code changes to hbase.regionserver package are minor.--4. the format of a hfileblock is the header followed by the data followed by the-checksum(s). each 16 k (configurable) size of data has a 4 byte checksum.  the-hfileblock header has two additional fields: a 4 byte value to store the-bytesperchecksum and a 4 byte value to store the size of the user data-(excluding the checksum data). this is well explained in the associated-javadocs.--5. i added a test to test backward compatibility. i will be writing more unit-tests that triggers checksum verification failures aggressively. i have left a-few redundant log messages in the code (just for easier debugging) and will-remove them in later stage of this patch. i will also be adding metrics on-number of checksum verification failures/success in a later version of this-diff.--6. by default  hbase-level checksums are switched on and hdfs level checksums-are switched off for hfile-reads. no changes to hlog code path here.--test plan: the default setting is to switch on hbase checksums for hfile-reads -thus all existing tests actually validate the new code pieces. i will be writing-more unit tests for triggering checksum verification failures.--reviewers: mbautin--reviewed by: mbautin--cc: jira  tedyu  mbautin  dhruba  todd  stack--differential revision: https://reviews.facebook.net/d1521--git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/trunk@1298641 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68-"
